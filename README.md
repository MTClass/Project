### Data

Project repository: https://github.com/MTClass/Project


### Instructional demo

Using the [Class-13 demo](https://umbcvis.github.io/classes/class-12) as a starting point,
this demo shows how to reconstruct all the counties from the census tracts.

## Charts
Bar chart showing population of MD Counties-
blockbuilderis shown here-http://blockbuilder.org/MTClass/39e797c364a98a8f4dc8f7ea3c91f6b4
gist is at https://github.com/MTClass/Project/blob/master/bar.html
The Goal is to identify the counties with the greatest population, which is Montgomery County
Stacked Bar Chart
This chart shows the age cohort of MD Counties.  The chart is at -http://blockbuilder.org/MTClass/cb1415bd902757078f581bba71e887d4
Code it at stackedbar.html at https://github.com/MTClass/Project/tree/master
The chart will show how the population is distributed by age cohorts, which
will tell the story as to what age cohorts are concentrated in specific Counties, e.g., PG County has the largest population ages 20-24, perhaps because of UMD, and Montgomery County seems to attract retirees because it has a large cohort of population ages 65+.

## To Do

#### Technical

Specific objectives (create a separate gist for each one)

1. Create a population density map with census tract data with the legend 
    * http://blockbuilder.org/MTClass/237b48e16999f07a69fa01f880fb02bf
2. On the same map, draw County boundaries in a different color.
3. Create a circle over Rockville that can be dragged on the map
4. Create a hover function so that the counties are colored and the label with the name of the County shows with the arrow motion

#### Documentation

* Add specific links in your repository to identify your data sources -- "census.gov" isn't suffficient.
